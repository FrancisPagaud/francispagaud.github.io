  title={Plasma potential control in a magnetized plasma column using a thermionic cathode},
  author={Pagaud, F and Dolique, V and Vincent, S and Trotabas, B and Gueroult, R and Plihon, N},
  abstract={The ability to drive the plasma potential in a magnetized plasma column using strongly negatively biased emissive cathode is experimentally demonstrated. By analysing an extensive experimental dataset, and in particular the evolution of the radial profiles of the plasma parameters (plasma density, electron temperature, plasma potential) obtained for various background magnetic field and neutral filling pressure, we first show that current injection from a negatively biased cathode offers an additional level of control as compared to a cold cathode. The radial potential drop across the plasma column, i.e. perpendicular to the magnetic field, is observed to be proportional to the current injected at the cathode. The experimental observations are in excellent qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions (Trotabas and Gueroult 2022 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 31 025001), in particular for the scaling B^2/n_n of the plasma potential drop with magnetic field B and neutral filling pressure nn. However, the experimental dataset also reveals the existence of a strong electron sheath (up to a few times the electron temperature) at the outer edge of the plasma column, which is not currently included in the modelling.},

  title={Control and stability of magnetised plasma columns : plasma-cathode interactions and helicon plasma operation},

  author={Pagaud, F},
  abstract={Radial transport, azimuthal waves and instabilities are common features in magnetised plasmas, causing major challenges for plasma propulsion, plasma wakefield particle acceleration or fusion devices. Plasma properties control is desirable yet complex. This PhD thesis follows two goals, one being the use of an emissive cathode as a new parameter control and the other being the fundamental understanding of the helicon plasma operational stability. Firstly, the role of the injection of electrons inside a magnetised plasma column has been studied experimentally and numerically. The experimental set-up is a 80 cm long and 20 cm diameter vacuum vessel connected to a 11 cm wide glass tube. The argon gas at a base pressure of 0.13 Pa is ionised by a 3-turns inductive radio-frequency antenna supplied at 1 kW. Magnetic field ranging from 170 G to 340 G, ensures a weak magnetisation of the plasma. A large tungsten hot cathode was placed at the end of the plasma column to inject an important thermionic current. Electrical and optical measurements of the cathode temperature revealed a highly inhomogeneous cathode temperature profile due to plasma–cathode interactions. A detailed thermal modelling solved numerically accurately reproduces the heterogeneous rise in temperature witnessed experimentally. The operating regime was predicted in excellent agreement with experimental results.The fine understanding of the emissive cathode behaviour in presence of a surrounding magnetised plasma permitted to explore its influence on the plasma properties, and especially the plasma potential. An analytical approach based on a two-fluids plasma model and anisotropic electrical conductivities, predicting plasma potential control and plasma rotation regulation as a function of thermionic emission, has been applied and compared to a wide experimental dataset of plasma properties. The works presented confront the role of cross-field ion transport to experimental radial plasma potential scans with a semi-quantitative agreement, highlighting a new major application of emissive cathodes.Finally, a state-of-the-art helicon plasma source has been implemented to produce higher ionization rates. This new system required a complete characterisation of plasma properties through electrostatic probes and high-speed camera imaging. It reproduced well-known helicon plasma features such as E-H-W mode transitions, bistability and hysteresis, chirality emerging from the external magnetic field direction and the propagation of m = +1 whistler waves. Besides, it displayed complex behaviours such as H-W and W-W oscillations, or coexisting low-frequency Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. A strong multiscale core instability at 1080 G was also briefly investigated. Wave-mode identification based on theoretical growth rates, 2DFT modal decomposition and POD has been conducted, unravelling the physical mechanisms at stake.},

  abstract={Thermionic emission from a polycrystalline tungsten emissive cathode immersed in a magnetized plasma column is investigated experimentally and numerically. Electrical and optical measurements of the cathode temperature show a highly inhomogeneous cathode temperature profile due to plasma–cathode interactions. The spatially and temporally resolved cathode temperature profile provides an in-depth understanding of the thermionic electron current, in excellent agreement with experimental data. The plasma-cathode coupling leads to a sharp and heterogeneous rise in temperature along the cathode, which can eventually lead to unstable cathode operation, with divergent current growth. A detailed thermal modeling accurately reproduces the experimental measurements, and allows to quantify precisely the relative importance of heating and cooling mechanisms in the operation of the cathode immersed in the plasma. Numerical resolution of the resulting integro-differential equation highlights the essential role of heterogeneous ohmic heating and the importance of ion bombardment heating in the emergence of unstable regimes. Detailed thermal modelling enables operating regimes to be predicted in excellent agreement with experimental results.},

  title={Buckling versus crystal expulsion controlled by deformation rate of particle-coated air bubbles in oil},
  author={Saha, S and Pagaud, F and Binks, BP and Garbin, V},
  abstract={Oil foams stabilized by crystallizing agents exhibit outstanding stability and show promise for applications in consumer products. The stability and mechanics imparted by the interfacial layer of crystals underpin product shelf life, as well as optimal processing conditions and performance in applications. Shelf life is affected by the stability against bubble dissolution over a long time scale, which leads to slow compression of the interfacial layer. In processing flow conditions, the imposed deformation is characterized by much shorter time scales. In practical situations, the crystal layer is therefore subjected to deformation on extremely different time scales. Despite its importance, our understanding of the behavior of such interfacial layers at different time scales remains limited. To address this gap, here we investigate the dynamics of single, crystal-coated bubbles isolated from an oleofoam, at two extreme time scales: the diffusion-limited time scale characteristic of bubble dissolution, ∼104 s, and a fast time scale characteristic of processing flow conditions, ∼10–3 s. In our experiments, slow deformation is obtained by bubble dissolution, and fast deformation in controlled conditions with real-time imaging is obtained using ultrasound-induced bubble oscillations. The experiments reveal that the fate of the interfacial layer is dramatically affected by the dynamics of deformation: after complete bubble dissolution, a continuous solid layer remains; after fast, oscillatory deformation of the layer, small crystals are expelled from the layer. This observation shows promise toward developing stimuli-responsive systems, with sensitivity to deformation rate, in addition to the already known thermoresponsiveness and photoresponsiveness of oleofoams.},

  title={The physics of Magnus gliders},
  author={Plihon, N and Legrand, G and Pagaud, F and Chemin, A and Ferrand, J and Taberlet, N},
  abstract={Magnus gliders are spinning toys displaying spectacular looped trajectories when launched at large velocity. These trajectories originate from the large amplitude of the Magnus force due to translational velocities of a few meters per second combined with a backspin of a few hundred radians per seconds. In this article, we analyse the trajectories of Magnus gliders built from paper cups, easily reproducible in the laboratory. We highlight an analogy between the trajectory of the glider and the trajectory of charged particles in crossed electric and magnetic fields. The influence of the initial velocity and the initial backspin on the trajectories is analyzed using high speed imaging. The features of these trajectories are captured by a simple model of the evolution of the Magnus and drag forces as a function of the spin of the gliders. The experimental data and the modeling show that the type of trajectory—for instance, the occurrence of loops—depends mostly on the value and orientation of the initial translational velocity regardless of the value of the backspin, while the maximum height of the apex depends on both the initial translational velocity and initial backspin.},

  title={Driven oscillations of a curved object under a laminar jet of water},
  author={Pagaud, F and Delance, L},
  abstract={By putting a ball on a flat surface under a jet of water, one may observe spontaneous oscillations of the ball of well-defined amplitude and frequency. As a simpler conformation, the study of a cylinder shows that the mere effect of the jet is sufficient to observe an oscillation for a certain range of parameters such as the curvature of the object and the characteristics of the jet. An empirical model of the forces strengthened by direct measurements of the forces and torque allowed us to predict a theoretical period of 0.64 s when the experimental one was 0.80 s. Further, the origin of the oscillation was determined to be a dynamic hysteresis of the torque as it is deflected on one side of the can even when the jet hits its center. This phenomenon results in a gain of energy that counterbalances the losses by friction and leads to oscillations. Domain of oscillation is also shortly addressed while improvements of the theoretical model and other experiments are suggested as well.},
