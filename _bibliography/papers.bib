  abstract={Thermionic emission from a polycrystalline tungsten emissive cathode immersed in a magnetized plasma column is investigated experimentally and numerically. Electrical and optical measurements of the cathode temperature show a highly inhomogeneous cathode temperature profile due to plasma–cathode interactions. The spatially and temporally resolved cathode temperature profile provides an in-depth understanding of the thermionic electron current, in excellent agreement with experimental data. The plasma-cathode coupling leads to a sharp and heterogeneous rise in temperature along the cathode, which can eventually lead to unstable cathode operation, with divergent current growth. A detailed thermal modeling accurately reproduces the experimental measurements, and allows to quantify precisely the relative importance of heating and cooling mechanisms in the operation of the cathode immersed in the plasma. Numerical resolution of the resulting integro-differential equation highlights the essential role of heterogeneous ohmic heating and the importance of ion bombardment heating in the emergence of unstable regimes. Detailed thermal modelling enables operating regimes to be predicted in excellent agreement with experimental results.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Pagaud, F and Dolique, V and Vincent, S and Trotabas, B and Gueroult, R and Plihon, N},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
