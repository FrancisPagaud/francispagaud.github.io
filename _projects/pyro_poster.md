    The tungsten filament already glows at 1000 K, but needs to reach 2500 K to emit electrons.

The current extracted from a tungsten hot filament could be unsteady, with a puzzling runaway behaviour leading to extreme current injection in the plasma. This unexpected behavior can hinder the use of hot cathodes as a new plasma control tool. 
As revealed by pyrometry experiments, temperature profile exhibits strong heterogeneities. And the main reason is: electrons prgoressively leave the metal to enter the plasma, leading to a decreasing current in the filament along its length. We developed a thorough model of the plasma-cathode dynamic system to understand and characterize the operating regimes.
