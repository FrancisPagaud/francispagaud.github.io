List of upgrades to come:

-Update all my posters and presentations ready for open access. Each poster project should contain the image and the pdf of the poster. The PDFs could be made available with a top roght corner icon like CV.
-Change the description to something more formal.
-For presentations, it should display the first slide and the .PDF and .PPT files should be made public.

-Teaching part: I would like to list all my agregation files and .Py codes. Ideally I display my previous teaching activities materials.
