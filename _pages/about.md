Welcome to my personal website. I am a French researcher in Fluid Mechanics, currently working at <b>CAPS (ETH Zürich, Switzerland)</b> on flow physics and hydrogen combustion. I focus mainly on fundamental aspects of thermoacoustic and aeroacoustic instabilities, using experimental and numerical methods.

I also have a cold plasma expertise following my PhD at Laboratoire de Physique à l'ENS de Lyon, France. I studied plasma-surface interactions and plasma instabilities through high-speed imaging and modal decomposition. 

My second passion is teaching and science popularization, and I am currently Teaching Assistant in Thermodynamics II at ETH Zürich. 

You are more than welcome to send me an e-mail if you want to discuss any of these topics with me.
